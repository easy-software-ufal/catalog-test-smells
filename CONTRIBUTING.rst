How to contribute
###################


First, you must know what you want to contribute.

1. Is it a new smell?
2. Have you found a bug?
3. Do you want to modify an already cataloged smell?


1. Contribuiting with a new smell
----------------------------------
You may create a new smell page, following the `template.rst` available on this very directory, or open a new issue on our GitHub page.

2. Bug reporting
-------------------------------
If you have found a bug, edit the page on GitHub or create a new issue!


3. I want to modify an already cataloged smell
--------------------------------
You need to create a new pull request with the changes or email us on easy@ic.ufal.br

  You may click on Edit on GitHub in the top right corner of any page of the catalog to get fast access to our GitHub repo!
