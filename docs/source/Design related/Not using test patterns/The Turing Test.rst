The Turing Test
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* A testcase automagically generated by some expensive tool that has many, many asserts gleaned from the class under test using some too-clever-by-half data flow analysis. Lulls developers into a false sense of confidence that their code is well tested, absolving them from the responsibility of designing and maintaining high quality tests. If the machine can write the tests for you, why can't it pull its finger out and write the app itself!
