The Open Catalog of Test Smells
===================================

Welcome!

Search for a test smell using the **search** or the **sidebar** --- works with test smells descriptions too --- if you already know what to look for. If not, you may browse by category in the left panel. Download options (PDF and EPUB) are available in the `Read the Docs` menu (bottom of left panel). There is a **lot** to see!

The catalog provides a visualization of the data set compiled in a Multivocal Literature Review published here. Initially, the catalog unifies information from 127 formal and informal sources. As the catalog is open-source, any community member can submit a contribution as a pull request and help improve it.

Every listed test smell contains a name, AKA (when available), definition, code example (likely extracted from the listed references), and the listed references, which of course provide further information. We expect the catalog to be a helpful resource for software testing community members to better understand test smells. Furthermore, it may help avoid proposing new names (AKA) to existing test smells in an overlap.
