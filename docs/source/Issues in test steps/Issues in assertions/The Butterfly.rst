The Butterfly
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* You have to test something which contains data that changes all the time, like a structure which contains the current date, and there is no way to nail the result down to a fixed value. The ugly part is that you don't care about this value at all. It just makes your test more complicated without adding any value.

**Also Known As:**

* Sensitive Equality
