Fragile Tests
^^^^^
Definition:

* Tests which seem to break when they shouldn't


Code Example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  describe Post do
    let(:user) { build_stubbed(:user) }
    let(:title) { "Example Post" }
    subject(:post) { build_stubbed(:post, user: user, title: title) }

    # ...

    context "with an author" do
      let(:user) { build_stubbed(:user, name: "Willy") }

      it "returns the author's name" do
        expect(post.author_name).to eq("Willy")
      end
    end
  end
