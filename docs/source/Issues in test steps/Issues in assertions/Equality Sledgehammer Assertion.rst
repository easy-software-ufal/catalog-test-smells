Equality Sledgehammer Assertion
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* where the interesting behaviour we are trying to prove is a subset of asserting the equality of everything, for example just knowing the count would be enough, but we assert all values in all rows – don’t go too far, through, and end up with a Blinkered Assertion – the likely cause of this smell is lack of imagination when writing an assertion and just landing on equals
