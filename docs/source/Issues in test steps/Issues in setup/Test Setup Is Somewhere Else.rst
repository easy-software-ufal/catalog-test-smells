Test Setup Is Somewhere Else
^^^^^
Definition:


* Where the test method just does the assertions, not the given/when part; this can be acceptable in the case of several tests on a single shared expensive resource setup, but seldom is at other times.

Code Example:

.. code-block:: java

  @Test
  void theOperationIsSuccessful() {
      assertTrue(service.isLastOperationSuccessful());
  }
