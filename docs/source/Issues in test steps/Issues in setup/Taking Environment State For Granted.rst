Taking Environment State For Granted
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* Taking environment state for granted is often over optimistic. Unlike in unit tests, end-to-end setup gives little control over test environment state, particularly when it is shared with other teams. When the test starts failing it might be because of a new bug introduced or because environment is not in a state your test needs.
