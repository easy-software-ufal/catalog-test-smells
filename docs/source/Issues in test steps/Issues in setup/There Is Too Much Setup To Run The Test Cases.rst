There Is Too Much Setup To Run The Test Cases
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* Tests require an excessive amount of setup just to be able to run. This may be in the Arrange stage of the individual tests or in a setup method that runs before the tests. There can be hundreds of lines of code in some cases where there is too much setup needed. This makes it almost impossible to understand what is being tested because of all the extra in the setup.
