Embedding Implementation Detail In Your Features/Scenarios
^^^^^
Definition:

* Acceptance test scenarios are meant to convey intention over implementation. If you start seeing things like URLs in your test scenarios youâ€™re focusing on implementation.


Code Example:

    Scenario: Social media links displayed on checkout page
    Given I am the checkout page for Australia
    Then I should see a link to 'http://twitter.com/beautifultea'
    And I should see a link to 'https://facebook.com/beautifultea'
