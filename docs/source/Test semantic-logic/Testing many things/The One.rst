The One
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* A combination of several patterns, particularly The Free Ride and The Giant, a unit test that contains only one test method which tests the entire set of functionality an object has. A common indicator is that the test method name is often the same as the unit test name, and contains multiple lines of setup and assertions.

**Also Known As:**
