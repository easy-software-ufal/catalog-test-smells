**Definition:**

* A test case that doesn’t even belong in the unit test it is part of. it’s really testing a separate object, most likely an object that is used by the object under test, but the test case has gone and tested that object directly without relying on the output from the object under test making use of that object for its own behavior. Also known as TheDistantRelative
