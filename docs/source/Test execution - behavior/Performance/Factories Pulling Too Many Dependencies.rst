Factories Pulling Too Many Dependencies
^^^^^
Definition:

* Calling one factory may silently create many associated records, which accumulates to make the whole test suite slow (more on that later)


Code Example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  FactoryBot.define do
    factory :comment do
      post
      body "groundbreaking insight"
    end
  end
