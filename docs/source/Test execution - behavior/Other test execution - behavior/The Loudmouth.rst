The Loudmouth
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* A unit test (or test suite) that clutters up the console with diagnostic messages, logging messages, and other miscellaneous chatter, even when tests are passing. Sometimes during test creation there was a desire to manually see output, but even though itâ€™s no longer needed, it was left behind.

**Also Known As:**

* Transcripting Test
