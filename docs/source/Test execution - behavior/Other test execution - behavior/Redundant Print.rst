Redundant Print
^^^^^
Definitions:

* Print statements in unit tests are redundant as unit tests are executed as part of an automated. Furthermore, they can consume computing resources or increase execution time if the developer calls an intensive/long-running method from within the print method (i.e., as a parameter).
* Print statements in unit tests are redundant as unit tests are executed as part of an automated process with little to no human intervention. Print statements are possibly used by developers for traceability and debugging purposes and then forgotten.
