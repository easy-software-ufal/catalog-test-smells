The Mockery
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* Sometimes mocking can be good, and handy. But sometimes developers can lose themselves and in their effort to mock out what isn’t being tested. In this case, a unit test contains so many mocks, stubs, and/or fakes that the system under test isn’t even being tested at all, instead data returned from mocks is what is being tested.

**Also Known As:**

* Mock Happy, Mock-Overkill
