Mixed Selectors
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* The problem of mixing up all the methods of a test-class is that it is harder to allocate and differentiate accessors, xtures, utilities and test-methods. By putting each type of method into a different method category, especially strictly separating test-methods from other methods we get a better structure of the test-class. A better and cleaner structure helps in understanding the test-suite, the xtures and all the test-methods.
