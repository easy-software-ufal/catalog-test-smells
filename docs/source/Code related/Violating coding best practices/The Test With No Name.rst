The Test With No Name
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* The test that gets added to reproduce a specific bug in the bug tracker and whose author thinks does not warrant a name of its own. Instead of enhancing an existing, lacking test, a new test is created called testForBUG123. Two years later, when that test fails, you may need to first try and find BUG-123 in your bug tracker to figure out the test's intent.

**Also Known As:**

* The Enumerator
