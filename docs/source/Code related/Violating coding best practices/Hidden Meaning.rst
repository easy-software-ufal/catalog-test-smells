Hidden Meaning
^^^^^
Definition:

* Where something that should be part of the execution of the test, and appear in a test report, is hidden in a comment â€“ essentially comment instead of name


Code Example:

.. code-block:: java

  @Test
  public void restApi() {
      int response = client.get("/endpoint");
  
      // the status code returned from the get
      // should be OK, indicating
      // the endpoint is healthy
      assertEquals(200, response);
  }
