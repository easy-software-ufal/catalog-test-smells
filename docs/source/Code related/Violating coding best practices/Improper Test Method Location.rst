Improper Test Method Location
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* Smalltalk-developers normally organize their source-code in packages, classcategories and method-categories. Although there is no common convention for doing so, most projects we encountered during our case study are organized in a very similar fashion. However we also noticed that tests are sometimes excluded from that.
