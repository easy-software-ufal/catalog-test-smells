The Forty Foot Pole Test
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* Afraid of getting too close to the class they are trying to test, these tests act at a distance, separated by countless layers of abstraction and thousands of lines of code from the logic they are checking. As such they are extremely brittle, and susceptible to all sorts of side-effects that happen on the epic journey to and from the class of interest.
