Accidental Test Framework
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* related to over exertion asserts, where thereâ€™s an ad-hoc bit of what should be a test library, this also includes home-made shallow implementations for deep problems like managing resources such as database or file. It also includes manually pumping framework primitives, rather than using the framework as a whole.
