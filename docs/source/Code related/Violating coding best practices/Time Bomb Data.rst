Time Bomb Data
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* when testing with dates or times, and the choice of test data leads either to a test that starts to fail in the future, because the current date has changed to a point where the test data is wrong, or where the full range of relevant date variations is not covered, leading to a bug in the production code on certain days
