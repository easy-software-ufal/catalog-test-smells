Tests Require Too Much Intimate Knowledge Of The Code To Run
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* Tests only need to know about the methods they are testing, and even then only the interface or what is going in and coming out of them not specific implementation details. This particular anti-pattern or set of them comes from attempts to get 100% code coverage.
