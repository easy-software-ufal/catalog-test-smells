Overly Complex Tests
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* Unit tests, like production code, should be easily understandable. In general, a programmer must understand the intent of an individual test as fast as possible. If a test is so complicated that you canâ€™t immediately tell if it is correct or not, it makes it very difficult to determine if the cause of a test failure is bad production code or bad test code. Even worse, this allows the possibly of code that incorrectly passes a test.
