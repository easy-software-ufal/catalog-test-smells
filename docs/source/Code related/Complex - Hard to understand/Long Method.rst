Long Method
^^^^^
**Definition:**

* It's where a method or function has too many responsibilities. Many times a method does not start off being too long, but over time it grows and grows, taking on additional responsibilities. This poses an issue when tests want to call into a method to do one thing, but will ultimately have multiple other things executed as well.

**Also Known As:**

* Long Function
